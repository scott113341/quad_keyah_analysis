# Four Corners Quad Keyah Analysis

I ran the 2023 Four Corners Quad Keyah half marathon trail race series. After one of the races, some of the runners and
I were wondering how much distance was in each state. For example, on the "Arizona" race, how much distance was in
Arizona versus CO/UT/NM? This repo contains code/infra that performs this analysis. If you want to run it yourself, run
the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scott113341/quad_keyah_analysis.git
cd quad_keyah_analysis
docker build -t quad_keyah_analysis:latest --progress=plain .
docker run quad_keyah_analysis:latest
```

The results:

Note that the routes were from MY runs, which aren't necessarily what others ran (I definitely ran extra in the Arizona
and Colorado races) but it's Fineâ„¢. Links to my runs:
